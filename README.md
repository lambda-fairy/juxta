# juxta

A library for writing composable comparison functions.

*juxta* has the following features:

* **Composable**. You can express "sort by X then by Y" and "sort X before Y" using a uniform API.
* **Type-safe**. *juxta* has complete TypeScript definitions. If it compiles, it (probably) works.
* **Pithy**. Common use cases should take as little boilerplate as possible.
